# Weather-Prediction
• Implemented a weather forecasting model to predict temperature and precipitation accurately.
• Conducted data preprocessing to clean and transform raw data for improved model performance.
• Used Ridge Regression to regularize data and prevent overfitting in the forecasting model.
• Utilized historical weather data from NOAA to train predictive models with high reliability.
